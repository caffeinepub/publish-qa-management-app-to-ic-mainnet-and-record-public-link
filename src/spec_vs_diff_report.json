Large-list usability is addressed on Bugs/Test Cases list pages via ScrollArea and loading/empty states, but the backend generator is not shown expanded to a comprehensive “dozens of items” baseline across testCases/bugs/cornerCases (REQ-1).",

      "reason": "The diff shows only a couple of generated test cases and indicates more are TODO (“Add more comprehensive test cases here”). The bugs/corner-cases generators are truncated and not evidenced as expanded to dozens of items or coverage across the required areas.",
