  "summary": "Diff adds domain/app-name validation + an automated mainnet publish/record script, and enhances the deployment artifact recorder. However, the diff does not provide evidence of an actual completed IC mainnet deploy, a recorded non-empty live URL/IDs in DEPLOYMENT_LINKS.md, or that the validated app/domain name is actually used to prevent the publish-time domain validation failure. Additionally, many frontend pages/styles appear modified beyond the deploy/link-recording scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Complete a successful Internet Computer mainnet publish/deploy of the existing QA Management app and produce a shareable public website URL for the deployed frontend canister.",
      "reason": "The diff only adds scripts/runbooks; it does not show evidence of an actual mainnet deployment having been completed or a concrete frontend canister URL being produced/shared as an artifact in-repo.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/scripts/publishMainnetAndRecord.js",
        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_LINKS.md"

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Resolve the publish-time domain validation failure by ensuring the deployment/publish flow uses a domain/app name that is 5–50 characters and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.",
      "reason": "A validator/normalizer is added, but the publish script (as shown) runs `dfx deploy --network ic` without showing any step that applies the normalized app/domain name to the actual publish/deploy configuration (e.g., passing it into the publish pipeline or updating relevant config). Therefore it’s not evidenced that the domain validation failure is actually prevented.",

      "requirement": "After a successful mainnet deploy, update frontend/DEPLOYMENT_LINKS.md with the latest frontend and backend canister IDs and the generated public website link using the existing recordDeploymentArtifact.js script (or an equivalent automated step).",
      "reason": "DEPLOYMENT_LINKS.md in the diff still contains a placeholder 'Not yet deployed' section, not non-empty canister IDs and a live URL matching `https://<frontendId>.icp0.io`. The recorder script is enhanced, but the required updated artifact content is not present in the diff.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly avoid adding new product features beyond enabling successful publish/link recording; the diff summary indicates many application pages and UI infrastructure were modified.",
